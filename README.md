# 📘 JavaScript Journey – From Fundamentals to Advanced Concepts

Welcome to my **JavaScript Journey** repository – a structured, hands-on log of my progress through core and advanced JavaScript topics. I'm learning directly from the **Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)** and documenting my knowledge with real examples and personal notes.

This repository contains **focused lecture files**, not full projects — so you can learn each concept clearly and efficiently without the clutter.

## 🔍 Topics Covered

### 🔁 Lecture 1 – Loop Iteration

Mastering different loop structures:

* `for`, `while`, and `do...while` loops
* `for...in` and `for...of`
* `break` & `continue` for control flow

---

### 🔧 Lecture 2 – Functions & Arrow Functions

Understanding JavaScript's flexible function system:

* Traditional vs. arrow functions
* Nested functions
* Practical examples: Fibonacci & Factorial
* Bonus: Bitwise & ternary operators

---

### 📅 Lecture 3 – String, Number, Date, and RegEx

Key built-in JavaScript objects:

* Common `String` & `Number` methods
* Real-time clock using `Date`
* Intro to Regular Expressions (with [regexr.com](https://regexr.com))

---

### 🧮 Lecture 4 – Indexed Collections (Arrays & Objects)

Handling structured data:

* Arrays, objects, and maps
* Sparse arrays
* `forEach`, multidimensional arrays
* Built-in array methods

---

### 🗝️ Lecture 5 – Keyed Collections

Understanding modern JS collections:

* `Map` vs `Object`
* `Set` vs `Array`
* `WeakMap` and `WeakSet`
* Using `.set()` and `.get()`
* Deleting elements

---

### 🏗️ Lecture 6 – Classes in JavaScript

Object-oriented programming fundamentals:

* Defining classes & constructors
* Instance methods
* `extends` & inheritance
* Using `get` & `set`

---

### ⏳ Lecture 7 – Promises & Async Flow

Async programming with Promises:

* Promise syntax and structure
* `.then`, `.catch`, `.finally`
* `Promise.all`, `Promise.any`, `Promise.race`, `Promise.allSettled`

---

### ⚙️ Lecture 8 – Generator Functions

Controlling iteration manually:

* Custom iterators
* `function*` and `yield`
* `next()` method with `{ value, done }`

---

### 🧬 Lecture 9 – Prototypes & Inheritance

Deep dive into JavaScript inheritance:

* Shadowing built-in prototypes
* Chaining and setting prototypes
* Inheritance using `class`
* Practice from MDN docs

---

### ⚡ Lecture 10 – Asynchronous Functions

Understanding async behavior:

* Why sync code can block UI
* Async solutions using `setTimeout`, `addEventListener`, `fetch`
* `async/await` for clean async logic

---

### 🎨 Canvas in JavaScript

Interactive graphics & animation:

* Drawing shapes
* Animating with JS loops
* Collision detection & interaction
* Adding images to canvas
* Handling canvas events

---

## 🧠 Learning Approach

* Learning from **MDN docs** + experimentation
* Focused lecture files (`Lecture1.js`, `Lecture2.js`, etc.)
* No heavy project scaffolding — just clean JS!

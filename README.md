# JavaScript_Journey
JS from beginner to advance level
In this Repo, We will see all the JavaScript topic from beginner to advance level throughout my learning ecperince and I am learning Javascript from Mozilla documentation.
If you want to learn from it you can learn from the mozilla documnetation.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Loop_Iteration
In Lecture1.js, we learn the different type of loop iteration method like :-
1. for loop
2. do...while loop
3. while loop
4. for...in loop
5. for...of loop
6. break and continue statement
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Function & Arrow function
In Lecture2.js, we learn about how these javascript function works and they can be work as nested and the perfect example of nested function are2 Fibonacci Series & Factorial number 
Total learning was like :- 
1. JS function
2. Calling the function
3. Function Parameters
4. Arrow function
5. BITWISE operator
6. Ternary operator
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# String, Number, Date function & Regular expression
In Lecture3.js, we learn about string, no. & date function as there are numerous string and number function, I didn't include in documentation you can learn it directly from mozilla documentation 
As we also meantion regular expression as it's a very vast topic so I will suggest you learn it from regexr.com , Today learning :-
1. String function
2. Number function
3. Date function and built proper digital clock
4. Regular Expression from regexr.com
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Indexed Collections
In Lecture4.js, we learn about the arrays, maps & object structure and types and different way to declare them and understand their fucntioning and get to know how to modify them 
and also learn their lot of built in function but did not mention in the document, so you have to learn it from mozilla documentation, Today's learning was like :-
1. Array & Object building
2. Creation of sparse arrays
3. Array built-in function
4. For...each loop
5. Creates multi dimensional array using for...in loop
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Keyed Collection
In Lecture5.js, we learn about the Map and its strucute and its basic built in fucntion and Its work same as object and just have minor differences, WeakMap is same as map with just weak references 
as it takes key as object and we also learn Set, it work same as array but it eleminate the duplicate values, WeakSet is same as Set but it take values as object a;lso with weak references, topics covered :-
1. Map and its build-in function
2. Differnce between Map & Object
3. WeakMap and its features
4. Set and its built in function
5. Differences between Set & Array
6. WeakSet and its features
7. Deleting the element from object
8. set & get function
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Classes in JS
In Lecture6.js, we learn about the classes in js , how to declare and what is constructor and how constructor works , what is instance method and how they are created and also see their alternative 
that they also can be write inside the constructor of a classes and also learn about their extends & inheritance, topics covered are :-
1. Declaration of classes
2. Constructor
3. Instance methods
4. Extend & inheritance
5. set & get
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
# Promises in JS
In Lecture7.js, we learn about the promises in js , why we need promises to perform task and also know the callback hell and learn the declaration and structure of promises in js and learn about the 
promises chaning & error handling (using then, catch, finally) and we learn some of promises function like [Promise.any , Promise.race, Promise.allsettled] , topics covered :-
1. Promise declaration
2. Error handling
3. Promise function
4. Promise Chaining
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Generator function in JS
In Lecture8.js, we learn about the generator function in js , why they are used and how they are helpfull because when we build iteration function from scratch we cannot use for build in fucntion 
so the generator function overcome this problem and we can use for function in our scratch iteration function , topics learned todays :-
1. Iteration fundamental
2. Generator function
3. Next() with done & values
4. yield keyword
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Prototype in js
In Lecture9.js, we learn about the Prototype  in js [topic going on ]... topic covered till now :-
1. Shadowing Prototype
2. Prototype chain
3. Setting Prototype
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
